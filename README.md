## About the Project/Game
You Are Your Worst Enemy (yaywe) is a 2D platformer designed to be based around speed.  
Make it towards the end while avoiding a clone of yourself.

## How to Install
Go either to releases on the right or to ![itch.io](https://sonuthenecro.itch.io/yaywe) and download the .rar file.  
If Windows prompts you about a virus, that is because I'm not spending money to get a monthly certificate for a game I made in a month.  
If it isn't trusted, feel free to look through the source code or compile it yourself.

## Known Issues
No Music  
Lava double kills you  
Spamming space lets you semi-glide (Feature now)  
Landing SFX doesn't properly work
